 * A #InfCommunicationObject is the destination of network messages sent
 * through the #InfCommunicationManager. Each #InfCommunicationGroup is
 * associated with #InfCommunicationObject. Requests received by that group
 * are reported to the #InfCommunicationObject by calling
 * inf_communication_object_received() on it. Messages sent to a member of
 * that group (via inf_communication_group_send_message()) are also reported
 * by calling inf_communication_object_sent().

 * @object: A #InfCommunicationObject.

 * @node: The received data.
 * @error: Location to store error information, if any.
 *
 * This function is called when a #InfCommunicationManager received data from
 * @connection belonging to a group whose communication object is @object.
 * This function should process the incoming data. If it could not process it,
 * then it should set @error.
 *
 * It should return %INF_COMMUNICATION_SCOPE_GROUP if the message is allowed
 * to be forwarded to other group members. Since recipients of forwarded
 * messages don't see the original sender (but just the forwarding host),
 * forwarding arbitrary messages could lead to a security problem in the worst
 * case.
 *
 * For example, if, in central mode, a client sends an (invalid)
 * &lt;add-node&gt; request to the whole (InfDirectory) group, and the server
 * forwarded this to all clients, those clients would try to create a new node
 * although the server rejected the request. In decentral mode, this is not a
 * problem since all clients see where the message comes from, and can
 * themselves reject all messages not coming from the server.
 *
 * Return Value: %INF_COMMUNICATION_SCOPE_GROUP if the message is allowed to
 * be forwarded, %INF_COMMUNICATION_SCOPE_PTP if not.
