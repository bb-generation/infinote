libinfinity 0.2.0:

	* infinoted records sessions to ~/.infinoted-records
	* Added proper modification tracking, and an autosave feature for
	  infinoted.
	* Implemented InfStandaloneIo on Windows, making infinoted run on
	  Windows
	* Refactored connection manager, introducing InfCommunication API for
	  high-level network handling. This breaks protocol compatibility with
	  libinfinity 0.1.x.

	  Gregory Haynes)

	* Fixed pasting a lot amount of text (#387, Benjamin Herr)
	* Fixed connection to server with much history (#389, Matthias Prinz)

libinfinity 0.1.0:

	* Initial release of libinfinity
	* Provides an API for real-time collaboration on plain text documents
	* This in an UNSTABLE release! Both API and ABI are about to change
	  in future versions. The 0.1.x line is guaranteed to be stable,
	  though.
