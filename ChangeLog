	text plugin.

	* infinoted/Makefile.am: Link against text plugin.

2008-12-22  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-io.c (inf_io_event_get_type): Null-terminate
	the list of flags values.

	warning.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.c
	(inf_adopted_request_log_is_empty): Use g_return_val_if_reached
	instead of g_return_if_reached, to avoid a warning.
	(inf_adopted_request_log_add_request): Cast the log to GObject before
	calling g_object_notify_freeze, to avoid a warning.

2008-12-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	(inf_xmpp_connection_send_chars): Fix a warning caused by += being
	used on a void pointer.
	(inf_xmpp_connection_process_features): Cast a xmlChar* to const char*
	before passing to strcmp(), to avoid a warning.

2008-12-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Added ctype.h inclusion.

2008-12-13  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	status of the buffer. If the buffer is considered not modified in a
	certain state, then set it modified if the buffer changes, but set it
	non-modified again when all users undid their changes since the last
	time when the buffer was considered non-modified.

	* infinoted/infinoted-autosave.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-autosave.c:
	* infinoted/Makefile.am: Added an autosaver for infinoted.

	* infinoted/infinoted-options.h:

	infd_directory_iter_save_session(), and the "add-session" and
	"remove-session" signals.

2008-11-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-hue-chooser.c: Don't use
	cairo_format_stride_for_width, so we don't need cairo 1.6 (Bug #393).

2008-11-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.c: Added
	inf_adopted_request_log_set_begin() and
	inf_adopted_request_log_is_empty().

	that the request is either contained in the user's request log, or
	is to be added.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c: Upon successful
	synchronization, set begin index of empty request logs to the
	corresponding user's time of the current state vector (#389, Matthias

2008-11-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-user-table.c: Fixed a typo that prevented

2008-11-08  Benjamin Herr  <ben@0x539.de>

	* libinfinity/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Properly advance data pointer
	on partial writes (fixed bug #387).

2008-11-05  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-move-operation.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-move-operation.c: Added a left_gravity parameter
	to inf_text_move_operation_transform_insert(). Always set it to TRUE
	in inf_text_move_operation_transform(), assuming a remote operation.

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Interpret all requests as non-caret
	versions by default. Use right gravity when adjusting the author's
	cursor on an insert operation.

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Block selection-changed signal
	handler of active user in inf_text_gtk_buffer_insert_text_cb() and
	inf_text_gtk_buffer_delete_range_cb() since GtkTextBuffer already
	takes care of adjusting the buffer marks in response to index changes
	on insert or delete operations.

	These changes fix pasting text over selected text (#390, Georg
	Kapeller).

2008-11-02  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Added a documentation note
	that this class is only available when LIBINFINITY_HAVE_AVAHI is
	defined.

2008-11-02  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* configure.ac: Add LIBINFINITY_HAVI_AVAHI as an AM_CONDITIONAL.

	* docs/reference/libinfinity/Makefile.am: Add inf-discovery-avahi.h to
	the header files to ignore, and pass --rebuild-types to gtkdoc-scan.
	This way, inf_discovery_avahi_get_type is not listed in the .types
	file when avahi support is not enabled (#386, Gregory Haynes).

	* docs/reference/libinftext/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinfgtk/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinftextgtk/Makefile.am: Also added --rebuild-types
	to gtkdoc-scan.

	* docs/reference/libinfinity/libinfinity.types:
	* docs/reference/libinftext/libinftext.types:
	* docs/reference/libinfgtk/libinfgtk.types:
	* docs/reference/libinftextgtk/libinftextgtk.types: Removed, since
	these are now autogenerated.

2008-11-02  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/note-plugins/text/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinity/methods/local-central/Makefile.am: Changed module
	installation path to be versioned.

	* libinfinity/common/Makefile.am: Adapt module lookup path
	accordingly.

2008-10-30  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-store.c
	(inf_gtk_browser_store_tree_model_iter_children): Make sure parent is
	not dereferenced for an assertion check if it is NULL, preventing a
	crash when this function was called with NULL parent and assertions
	enabled (#388).

2008-10-25  Philipp Kern  <phil@0x539.de>

	* configure.ac: check for MSG_NOSIGNAL
	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c: conditionally define
	INF_TCP_CONNECTION_SENDRECV_FLAGS

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-error.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-error.c: Added class and section
	documentation.

2008-10-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.c: Set localedir relative to libinfinity DLL on
	Windows, so i18n is properly relocatable.

2008-10-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* configure.ac: Post-release bump to 0.2.0.

2008-10-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* === Released 0.1.0 ===

2008-10-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-creds.c: Don't set the SAN to $hostname.local
	since the common name is no longer checked when a SAN is present.

	* infinoted/infinoted-startup.c (infinoted_startup_load_certificate):
	Error out if a self-signed certificate could not be created.

2008-10-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_send_ctrl): Fixed an assignment in an
	assertion that should be a comparison.
	(inf_connection_manager_group_real_send): Removed an unused variable.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c
	(inf_discovery_avahi_client_callback): Removed an unused variable.

2008-10-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* configure.ac: Don't require avahi-glib for avahi support, as we
	don't use it.

2008-10-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* docs/reference/libinftext/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinfgtk/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinftextgtk/Makefile.am: Added underlying libraries
	as --extra-dir to FIXXREF_ARGS.

	* docs/reference/libinfinity/libinfinity-docs.sgml:
	* docs/reference/libinftext/libinftext-docs.sgml:
	* docs/reference/libinfgtk/libinfgtk-docs.sgml:
	* docs/reference/libinftextgtk/libinftextgtk-docs.sgml: Adjust online
	location.

2008-10-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Add sync-in before emitting the
	NODE_ADDED signal, so that the signal handler can access the sync-in
	via infc_browser_iter_get_sync_in(). This allows InfGtkBrowserView to
	show progress for sync-ins.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view: Removed a TODO comment about showing
	progress for sync-ins.

2008-10-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-options.c: Don't crash when reading options from
	config files.

2008-10-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_group_real_send): Removed debug logs.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c: Consider INF_IO_ERROR with
	no error code as an ordinary disconnection. This is currently the way
	to be notified about disconnection on Windows, because InfGtkIo maps
	G_IO_HUP to INF_IO_ERROR.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-io.c: Also watch for G_IO_HUP in addition to
	G_IO_ERR when INF_IO_ERROR is requested.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_group_real_send): Make sure all queued
	messages are sent, even if the callback for the last item adds new
	messages to the queue.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-session.c (inf_session_close): Make sure the
	session's status is not already closed via a g_return_if_fail(), to
	prevent a failing assertion in the default handler.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_handle_message): Make sure a group's object is
	only finalized after we have unrefed the group, to prevent warnings
	when a received handler releases the NetObject.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c (inf_tcp_connection_send):
	Always queue data we could not sent immediately. There was a bug that
	data wasn't queued if more than the half of it has been sent already.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c
	(inf_xmpp_connection_received_cb): Don't call gnutls_record_recv with
	a NULL session when a TLS error occured.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-note-plugin.c
	(infinoted_note_plugin_load_directory): Added missing return value in
	success case.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Fixed a stupid type error in
	the setter for the wake-on-cursor-movement property.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinity/common/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinity/adopted/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinity/client/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinity/server/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinity/methods/local-central/Makefile.am:
	* libinftext/Makefile.am:
	* libinfgtk/Makefile.am:
	* libinftextgtk/Makefile.am:
	* infinoted/Makefile.am:
	* infinoted/note-plugins/text/Makefile.am:
	* test/Makefile.am: Moved -I$(top_srcdir) from AM_CPPFLAGS to
	$lib_CPPFLAGS, because the former is not used when the latter is
	present. This is required for `make distcheck'.

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Added version.xml.in to EXTRA_DIST.

	* docs/reference/libinfinity/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinftext/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinfgtk/Makefile.am:
	* docs/reference/libinftextgtk/Makefile.am: Added ../version.xml to
	content_files, to fix `make distcheck'.

	* docs/reference/libinfinity/libinfinity-docs.sgml: Reordered
	documentation sections.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c: Make sure that calling
	inf_tcp_connection_send() in a SENT callback does send things in a
	different order, or even breaks consistency of the queue.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_group_real_send): Fixed a memory corruption
	problem.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-note-plugin.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-note-plugin.c: Print a warning when no note
	plugins could be loaded.

	* infinoted/infinoted-startup.c: Don't start the server if there are
	no note plugins available.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* NEWS: Update for initial release.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Removed network traffic
	output.

2008-10-16  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* all source files: Fixed copyright period in GPL header, and changed
	the package description.

2008-10-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* configure.ac: Changed some occurences of infinote to libinfinity
	where the implementation rather than the protocol is meant. This
	changes the INFINOTE_HAVE_AVAHI define to LIBINFINITY_HAVE_AVAHI.

	* libinfinity/inf-config.h.in:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c:
	* infinoted/infinoted-run.c:
	* test/inf-test-daemon.c:
	* test/inf-test-gtk-browser.c:
	* doc/reference/version.xml.in: Adapt to the changes.

2008-10-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-dll.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-dll.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added new files that implement DllMain() on
	Windows, to save the DLL Handle. This can be used with
	g_win32_get_package_installation_directory_of_module().

	* libinfinity/common/Makefile.am: Split the METHODS_PATH define in
	METHODS_LIBDIR and METHODS_BASEDIR, where METHODS_BASEDIR is the
	application-specific part of the path.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-method-manager.c: On Windows, locate the
	methods relative to the libinfinity DLL instead of using a hardcoded
	path.

	* libinfinity/methods/local-central/Makefile.am: Added a comment about
	renaming renaming the directory into which the methods are stored.
	However, this doesn't work yet because of some evil libtool weirdness.

2008-10-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.h: Fixed a misleading comment in the first
	line, originating from a copy+paste from inf-config.h.

2008-10-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Make sure signals are emitted
	before data any is sent out for various operations.

2008-10-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c: Only queue new data if it
	can't be sent directly. This allows a call to
	inf_tcp_connection_send() to emit the "sent" signal directly.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c: Fixes to honor this.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c: Changed
	INF_TCP_CONNECTION_EINPROGRESS to be WSAEWOULDBLOCK on Windows because
	this is what connect() yields for non-blocking sockets.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-error.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-init.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-io.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-ip-address.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-standalone-io.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c:
	* libinfinity/server/infd-tcp-server.c: Fixed the build on Windows.
	InfStandaloneIo only has a stub implementation for now. GtkIo does not
	work correctly with glib 2.18, though I believe that's a regression in
	glib because it works with glib 2.16. Let's see whether I can track
	that down.

	* configure.ac: Don't require libuuid on Windows since we use native
	Windows API there.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-init.h: Include only <glib.h> for
	G_BEGIN_DECLS and G_END_DECLS, removed inculdes that we don't need in
	inf-init.h.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am:
	* libinftext/Makefile.am:
	* libinfgtk/Makefile.am:
	* libinftextgtk/Makefile.am:
	* infinoted/Makefile.am:
	* libinftextgtk/Makefile.am: Fixed linking order so that libraries
	that depend on others appear first in the command line.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/methods/local-central/Makefile.am:
	* infinoted/note-plugins/text/Makefile.am: Added -avoid-version,
	-module and -no-undefined LDFLAGS. Also fixed the linking order.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-options.c:
	* infinoted/infinoted-startup.c: Fixed a few warnings.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* po/LINGUAS: Added a file that lists all languages, as required by
	`make dist'.

	* configure.ac: Use that file to set ALL_LINGUAS.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-init.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-init.c
	* libinfinity/common/Makefile.am: New file that contains a function to
	initialize the library.

	* infinoted/infinoted-main.c: Don't call g_type_init() anymore in
	main().

	* infinoted/infinoted-startup.c: Instead, call inf_init() which does
	g_type_init in startup.

	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.c: Rely on gettext being initialized all the
	time. This means inf_init() needs to have been called before.

2008-10-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.h:
	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Added
	inf_text_gtk_buffer_get_wake_on_cursor_movement() and
	inf_text_gtk_buffer_set_wake_on_cursor_movement(). This setting
	specifies whether to make inactive users active when the cursor
	position of the underlying TextBuffer changes, or to resync when the
	user is explicitely set to be active.

2008-10-13  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Make sure only one author tag
	can be applied to a range of text. Applying multiple tags could still
	occur when copying and pasting text from the same buffer.

2008-10-13  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_handle_message): Keep a reference on the
	group that is currently processed, and unref at the end. This prevents
	a crash when net_object_received() does a final unref on the group.

2008-10-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_group_unref): Allow final unref of groups not
	in the tree (because of duplicate IDs). This is a temporary workaround
	until the handling of such groups has been fixed.

2008-10-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-store.c: Removed an unnecessary
	gtk_tree_model_row_changed() call.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c: Fixed automatic expansion of root
	node when multiple views show the same model.

2008-10-11  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c
	(inf_adopted_session_process_xml_sync): Don't leak the processed
	request.

	* inf_adopted_split_operation_revert
	(inf_adopted_split_operation_revert): Don't leak the two reverted
	child operations.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_group_free): Don't leak the
	InfConnectionManagerMethodInstance instance.
	(inf_connection_manager_handle_message): Don't leak scope_attr.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-session.c
	(inf_session_get_xml_user_props_impl): Don't leak status.

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c (inf_text_session_process_xml_sync):
	Don't leak the GIconv conversion descriptor.
	(inf_text_session_process_xml_sync): Don't leak text.

2008-10-09  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Don't assert when the
	avahi client could not be created. Even though we pass
	AVAHI_CLIENT_NO_FAIL, sometimes the client still can't be created it
	seems.

2008-10-09  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.c
	(inf_adopted_state_vector_vdiff): Changed an assertion that
	effectively checks an input parameter to a g_return_val_if_fail.

	* libinftext/inf-text-chunk.c: Disable chunk integrity check by
	default.

	* libinftext/inf-text-default-delete-operation.c: Disable text match
	check by default.

2008-10-09  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Don't let unavailable
	users prevent cleanup.

2008-10-09  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Send undo-caret and redo-caret. We
	still don't make a difference internally, but let's be gentle to
	implementations which do.

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Update "insert" and
	"selection-bound" markers when the active user's selection changes.

2008-10-09  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-run.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-run.c: Moved server running code from
	infinoted-main.c to a new file.

	* infinoted/infinoted-signal.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-signal.c: New files to handle SIGINT and SIGTERM
	properly by saving the directory and then shutting down.

	* infinoted/infinoted-main.c: Register the signals, call into
	infinoted-run.

	* infinoted/Makefile.am: Add the new files to the build.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-standalone-io.c
	(inf_standalone_io_iteration_impl): Return if poll returned EINTR, to
	allow shutting down the server in a signal handler.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-server-pool.c
	(infd_server_pool_entry_unpublish_with): Fixed unwanted fallthrough in
	a switch statement.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c
	(inf_discovery_avahi_unpublish): Fixed an assertion.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-split-operation.c: Fixed a typo in a
	comment.

2008-10-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-user.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-user.c:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-user.c:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.c:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.c:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Added a priv pointer to
	the instance struct, initialize it in instance_init and use this
	instead of calling g_type_instance_get_private all the time. This
	gets us a performance gain of about 9%.

2008-10-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinoted/infinoted-creds.c: Set the subject alternatime name to
	hostname.local for newly created self-signed certificates, because
	this is what avahi discovers in a local network.

2008-10-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-certificate-dialog.c: Fixed messages when the
	certificate has changed. The normal message and the one shown when the
	old certificate has expired were swapped.

2008-10-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-certificate-manager.c: Don't crash when no
	certificate warnings are shown, but just go on without showing a
	dialog.

2008-10-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Emit undiscovered signals
	on correct discovery infos.

2008-10-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Added a sasl-mechanisms
	property that specifies what mechanisms to accept or offer,
	respectively, for authentication.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-xmpp-server.h:
	* libinfinity/server/infd-xmpp-server.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Added the same property,
	and forward to created connections.

	* infinoted/infinoted-main.c:
	* test/inf-test-browser.c:
	* test/inf-test-daemon.c:
	* test/inf-test-gtk-browser.c:
	* test/inf-test-xmpp-connection.c: Adapt to API changes.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Don't unref the default method
	manager.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.c: Added
	inf_adopted_state_vector_vdiff().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Use that function to
	calculate required vdiffs, instead of a slower, own implementation.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.c: Added
	inf_adopted_state_vector_causally_before_inc().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Use this new function,
	to save some copies.

	* test/inf-test-state-vector.c: Verify that
	inf_adopted_state_vector_causally_before_inc(<empty state vector>,
	<empty state vector>, 1) yields FALSE.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.c: Fixed an assertion
	in inf_adopted_state_vector_add().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Cleaned up the code in
	inf_adopted_translate_request(), don't make a copy of the 'to'
	parameter anymore.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c
	(inf_adopted_algorithm_translate_request): Don't leak v when a cached
	request is returned.
	(inf_adopted_algorithm_execute_request): Don't leak log_request when
	the request must be made reversible.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.c
	(inf_adopted_request_transform), (inf_adopted_request_mirror): Don't
	leak the newly created operations.

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c (inf_text_session_xml_to_request):
	Don't leak the parsed operation.

	* test/inf-test-chunk.c: Don't leak the two chunks.

	* test/inf-test-text-operations.c: Don't leak the users array.

	* test/util/inf-test-util.c: Don't leak the XML content of <segment>
	nodes for buffers.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Removed the ugly
	can_cache paramatere for inf_adopted_algorithm_translate_request() and
	inf_adopted_algorithm_transform_request(). Instead, translate_request
	checks itself whether a request is cachable or not.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.c: Made InfAdoptedRequest
	immutable, which means that the request cannot be altered anymore once
	created. The functions inf_adopted_request_transform(),
	inf_adopted_request_mirror() and inf_adopted_request_fold() now return
	new requests instead of modifying the given one.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Adapt to that change.
	Given that requests are now immutable, we can save a few copies. This
	speeds up inf-test-text-session about 11%.

2008-10-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* test/util/inf-test-util.c (inf_test_dir_util_foreach): Iterate
	alphabetically through the file names.

	* test/inf-test-text-session.c: Actually make setting a random seed
	work, added time measurement.

2008-10-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session-record.c: Fixed a few
	warnings.

	* configure.ac: Added check-news to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

	* NEWS: Removed the dummy entry, so I don't forget to create a real
	one for the release.

2008-10-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-operation.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-operation.c: Added two new virtual
	functions, need_concurrency_id() and get_concurrency_id(). These are
	used to correctly handle situations when two requests insert text at
	the same position concurrently.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request.c: Added
	inf_adopted_request_need_concurrency_id() and
	inf_adopted_request_get_concurrency_id() which are simple wrapper
	functions for the underlying operation functions.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: If a concurrency ID is
	needed during transformation, then acquire one from the same requests
	in a previous state.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-no-operation.c:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-split-operation.c: Implement the two
	new virtual functions.

	* libinftext/inf-text-pword.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-pword.c: Removed, since pwords are no longer
	used. These did not handle the situation described above well enough,
	since the algorithm did not pass one of the tests in test/session
	since the request cache has been introduced (see my change from
	2008-02-22). The test in question is now test #28.
	
	Also, the adOPTed algorithm relies on the fact that it must not matter
	on which path a request has been transformed to reach a certain state.
	The pword concept did not fulfill this requirement.

	* libinftext/Makefile.am: Removed the files from the build.

	* libinftext/inf-text-insert-operation.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-insert-operation.c: Added
	inf_text_insert_operation_need_concurrency_id() and
	inf_text_insert_operation_get_concurrency_id(), and replaced the
	get_pword() virtual function by get_position().

	* libinftext/inf-text-delete-operation.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-delete-operation.c: Added
	inf_text_delete_operation_need_concurrency_id() and
	inf_text_delete_operation_get_concurrency_id().

	* libinftext/inf-text-default-insert-operation.c:
	* libinftext/inf-text-default-delete-operation.c:
	* libinftext/inf-text-remote-delete-operation.c:
	* libinftext/inf-text-move-operation.c: Implement the two new
	virtual functions from InfAdoptedOperation, and adapt to the
	get_pword() -> get_position() change in InfTextDefaultInsertOperation.

	* test/inf-test-text-operations.c: Correctly supply concurrency IDs
	for the C2 tests to pass.

	* test/inf-test-text-session.c: Always show the random seed used, also
	if given.

	* test/session/*.xml: Regenerated tests.

	* test/session/Makefile.am: Added the new files to the distribution.

2008-10-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.c: Added vim modelines.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-concurrency-warning.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-concurrency-warning.c: Helper files
	that contain a function to print a warning used in the upcoming
	modification of the algorithm when a concurrency ID is requested for
	types that don't support it yet.

	* libinfinity/adopted/Makefile.am: Add the files to the build.

2008-10-03  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c
	(inf_adopted_algorithm_translate_request): Simplified the code a bit.

2008-10-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.c: Added _inf_gettext_init() in case somebody
	needs the infinote gettext translation domain being set without having
	called _inf_gettext() before.

	* infinoted/infinoted-creds.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-creds.c: Fixed a typo.

	* infinoted/infinoted-options.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-startup.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-options.c:
	* infinoted/infinoted-startup.c: New files, containing some
	functionality from infinoted-main.c, due to code refactorings.

	* infinoted/infinoted-main.c: Adapt.

	* infinoted/Makefile.am: Build the new files.

	* README:
	* configure.ac: Require at least glib 2.16.

2008-09-29  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-cert-util.c (inf_cert_util_save_file): Fixed
	storage of more than one certificate.

2008-09-25  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-chunk.c: Fixed another problem when a chunk was
	inserted into another chunk between two segments when the last part
	could be merged.

	* test/replay/replay-03.record.xml:
	* test/replay/replay-04.record.xml: Added two new records, to test the
	the InfTextChunk.

2008-09-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-chunk.c: Fixed a problem when a chunk was
	inserted into another chunk between two segments, and the last part
	could not be merged.

	* test/inf-test-text-replay.c: Cleaned up the code a bit.

2008-09-22  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-chunk.c (inf_text_chunk_erase): Fixed a problem
	that the erase operation did not produce a correct result when both
	the first and the last segment of the erasure bounds were in
	different segments of the same author.

	* test/inf-test-text-replay.c: Added code to set a breakpoint just
	before the algorithm applies a request, to be able to debug the
	InfTextChunk internals.

2008-09-22  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* test/inf-test-text-replay.c: Added functionality to check for
	InfTextChunk errors by performing all the buffer operations on an
	(ascii-only) GString and comparing the result with the buffer.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Documented a missing
	parameter in InfAdoptedAlgorithm::execute-request.

	* test/replay/replay-01.record.xml:
	* test/replay/replay-02.record.xml: Added two records that currently
	fail to replay correctly.

2008-09-22  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Reorganized the code a bit, added
	inf_text_session_flush_requests_for_user().

2008-09-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.h:
	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Added
	inf_text_gtk_buffer_ensure_author_tags_priority().

2008-09-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-certificate-manager.c: Fixed a crash when setting
	a new trust file.

2008-09-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-store.c:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c: Allow activating an item with
	error status and discovery set in which case another connection
	attempt is made.

2008-09-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Fixed usage of alternative
	service name on collision.

2008-09-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c: Save new and synced-in sessions
	initially to storage, to prevent later data loss and to avoid a
	failure when a user deletes a newly added document (It has not
	yet been saved to storage, so the deletion of it caused an error).

2008-09-19  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-store.c: Fixed a crash when the network
	interface used goes suddenly down.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c: Fixed a reference counting
	problem.

2008-09-19  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	instantiating InfGtkCertificateView.

2008-09-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* update-potfiles: Added a small script to generate the
	po/POTFILES.in. It is simple, but enough for our needs.

2008-09-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c:

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Added a security-policy
	property that specifies how to decide whether to use TLS or not. This
	allows not to use TLS for specific purposes.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-xmpp-server.c:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.h:

2008-09-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* configure.ac:
	* Makefile.am: Added gettext support.

	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-i18n.c: New files containing the common _() macro

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c:

	* infinoted/infinoted-main.c:
	* infinoted/infinoted-note-plugin.c: Mark all translatable strings.
	Strings in g_warning() have been omitted, but it might make sense to
	mark them, too, or at least some of them.

2008-09-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Correctly import
	certificate chains, produce an error if the server does not provide a
	certificate.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-certificate-chain.c: Changed direction so
	that the first certificate is the server's and the last certificate is
	the root's, since this how we get the list from GnuTLS.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-certificate-dialog.c: Fixed showing certificate
	chains consisting of more than one certificate.

	* infinoted/infinoted-main.c: Fixed using a whole certificate chain
	for the server.

	* infinoted/infinoted-creds.h:
	* infinoted/infinoted-creds.c: Removed
	infinoted_creds_read_certificate and infinoted_creds_write_certificate
	since we use the inf_cert_util functions instead.

	* configure.ac:
	* README: Raise required GTK+ version to 2.12, since we use
	gtk_tree_view_set_show_expanders() which is only available since 2.12.

2008-09-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c: Fixed warnings about
	incompatible pointer type in calls to

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c inf_text_session_request_to_xml():
	Don't require a delete operation to be a InfTextDefaultDeleteOperation

2008-08-24  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c: Added

2008-08-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c: Added the "populate-popup" signal.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c
	(inf_connection_manager_open_group): Added correct const qualifiers
	to methods parameter.

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Don't disconnect from algorithm's
	signals in INF_SESSION_SYNCHRONIZING state, because we don't have an
	algorithm yet at that point. This prevents glib warnings.

	* test/inf-test-text-replay.c:
	* test/Makefile.am: Added test that replays a record from
	InfAdoptedSessionRecord internally (without visualization). This can
	be used to reproduce libinfinity bugs.

2008-08-22  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT,OBJECT,BOOLEAN

2008-08-14  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c
	(inf_text_gtk_buffer_buffer_iter_get_bytes): Fixed a bug when the
	iterator only contains a newline. In that case, the function fielded

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c: Double the interval
	within which noop requests are sent, and only send a noop if a remote
	request has been executed since the last request was sent.

2008-08-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Call base class dispose

	to have a name.

2008-07-23  Benjamin Herr  <ben@0x539.de>

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Apply attributes to operation xml

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c: Changed the
	xml_to_operation and operation_to_xml vfuncs to xml_to_request and
	request_to_xml, to allow generation of custom requests, and to
	decouple the update of local user's last send vector from the
	serialization of a request. Added
	inf_adopted_session_read_request_info() and
	inf_adopted_session_write_request_info() to ease implementation by
	derived classes.

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Adapted to API change.

2008-07-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c: Added documentation,

	g_object_new that creates the InfTextSession with NULL, preventing
	memory corruption.

2008-07-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c
	(infc_session_proxy_set_connection): Correctly thaw the notification
	queue of the session at the end of the function.

2008-07-11  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c: Update user tag
	"background-color" property on user color change.

2008-07-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c
	(inf_adopted_algorithm_can_undo_redo): Changed semantics of this
	function for non-local users so that it returns whether the user in
	question can issue an Undo or Redo command in its own current state
	(as known to the local site).

	* test/inf-test-text-cleanup.c: Allow can-undo and can-redo
	verifications when the user's vector does not match the current one
	from the algorithm.

	* test/cleanup/cleanup-05.xml:
	* test/cleanup/cleanup-06.xml:
	* test/cleanup/cleanup-07.xml: Yet another three tests.

2008-07-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c
	(inf_adopted_algorithm_cleanup): Don't use least common successor but
	least common predecessor as reference when cleaning up requests. This
	was always meant to be the predecessor, but used the successor until
	now because of me being stupid. Also fixed the cleanup process so that
	when all sites processed all operations the max total log size really
	is not exceeded.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.c
	(inf_adopted_request_log_remove_requests): Don't touch next-undo or
	next-redo when no requests are removed.

	* test/cleanup/cleanup-01.xml: Empty the initial buffer for
	simplicity.

	* test/cleanup/cleanup-02.xml:
	* test/cleanup/cleanup-03.xml:

2008-07-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Use G_MAXUINT instead
	of 0 for max-total-log-size to mean unlimited, so a max-total-log-size
	of 0 is allowed.

	* test/inf-test-text-cleanup.c:
	* test/inf-test-text-session.c: Only process XML files in the
	subdirectories, not Makefiles and other stuff.

2008-07-05  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c
	(inf_adopted_algorithm_can_undo, inf_adopted_algorithm_can_redo):
	Added support for returning undo/redo status for non-local users.
	However, this currently returns whether those users can issue
	undo/redo in the algorithm's current state. This especially means that
	a request received from such a non-local user may be valid even if
	this function returns false, if the request was generated at another
	state. This will probably be changed in the future to return whether
	the given user can issue an Undo/Redo request in its own state
	(as known to the local site).

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c: Added the
	"max-total-log-size" property that is delegated to the construction of
	the algorithm.

	* test/inf-test-text-cleanup.c: Added a test that reads XML files
	specifying test scenarios from test/cleanup to test whether the
	algorithm's cleanup routines (correctly shrink request logs, correctly
	issue can-undo/can-redo) work.

	* test/cleanup/cleanup-01.xml: First simple cleanup test.

	* test/session/Makefile.am:
	* test/cleanup/Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac: Add the test files to the distribution.

	* test/Makefile.am: Add the new file to the build.

	is deprecated.

	* test/util/inf-test-util.h:
	* test/util/inf-test-util.c: Moved some common functions used in
	multiple tests here for code reuse.

2008-07-03  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c
	(inf_text_gtk_buffer_insert_text_cb,
	inf_text_gtk_buffer_delete_range_cb): Revalidate iterators at the end,
	so that others can call gtk_text_buffer_insert and
	gtk_text_buffer_delete with normal semantics.

2008-06-29  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/server/infd-session-proxy.c: Don't assign user IDs that
	are already in use by users that were already in the initial session.

2008-06-28  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Fixed a crash when
	<stream:error> was received.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-session-proxy.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-session-proxy.c: Added
	infc_session_proxy_get_connection and
	infc_session_proxy_get_subscription_group, correctly unset underlying
	session's subscription group when the connection is released.

2008-06-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c
	(inf_adopted_session_constructor): Add initial local users to the list
	of local users.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c (infc_browser_handle_add_node):
	Fix the check for a <subscribe/> child being present.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-user-table.c
	(inf_user_table_add_user_handler): Ref users put into the user table.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-session.c (inf_session_net_object_sent):
	Don't assert that the sent message was a synchronization message if we
	found a synchronization to the connection since we could already have
	sent stuff that is meant to be processed after the synchronization.
	(inf_session_add_user): Unref user after having put it into the user
	table.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c: Removed the check that
	available users in a synced-session need to be from the synchronizing
	connections since that check has been moved to InfdSessionProxy.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-session-proxy.c: Added the mentioned check
	here, and additionally add the user to the list of subscribed users
	for that connection so that, when the connection unbsubscribes again,
	the user will be set to unavailable. Also removed the
	subscribe-sync-conn property, instead allow calling
	infd_session_proxy_subscribe_to() when the session is in
	INF_SESSION_SYNCHRONIZING state.

	synchronizing connection if not given.
	(inf_session_handle_received_sync_message): Cope with the fact that
	some callback in process_xml_sync could have cancelled the
	synchronization.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c: Make sure that available users
	in a synced-in session are from the synchronizing connection, and
	only allow them if the synchronizing connection is subscribed.
	Otherwise, close the session which effectively cancels the sync-in.

	signature to match GClosureNotify.
	(inf_text_session_segment_to_xml): Don't assert if the input text is

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c (infc_browser_handle_sync_in):
	Free type after it has been used, not before, and add the sync in
	after having created the node, because the sync-in needs to know the
	node.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-session-proxy.c
	(infc_session_proxy_net_object_received): Fix an assertion so that
	synchronization messages are passed to the underlying InfSession even
	when they do not come from the subscription connection.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c
	(infd_directory_node_add_sync_in): Send parent node of sync-in, add
	connection to sync group if it is not the subscription group.

	was closed explictely in response to the status change notify of
	the underlaying connection.
	(inf_session_synchronization_failed_handler): Don't assert on
	INF_SESSION_CLOSED since the session could be closed between the
	beginning of the signal emission and the run of the default handler.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c
	(infc_browser_net_object_received): If an error was set, and the node
	had a seq set, then fail the corresponding request since the server
	reply could not be processed.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c (infd_directory_add_sync_in):
	Unref the synchronization group after having passed it to
	_create_session_proxy().

	* libinftextgtk/inf-text-gtk-buffer.c
	(inf_text_gtk_buffer_set_active_user): Allow the new active user to be
	NULL to unset the active user, as used in _dispose().

2008-04-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Emit the subscribe-session signal
	before finishing a pending request, so that signal handlers of
	InfcNodeRequest::finished can access the newly created session via
	infc_browser_iter_get_session().

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Added some more comments
	about RFC compliance.

2008-03-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Build methods after having built

2008-03-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.c: Added a "name" column for

	* libinfinity/inf-config.h.in: Configuration file that only contains
	prefixed defines, so it is safe to be installed.

	inf_session_get_synchronization_progress(): Don't divide by zero if
	the initial sync-begin was not yet received.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c: Send noop request after
	15 seconds of inactivity.

2008-02-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Added

	selection-length properties construct only.

	because it is now provided by InfXmlConnection, override the local-id
	and remote-id properties by using the ip/port pair of the underlaying
	TCP connection. Allow gnutls to return with GNUTLS_E_AGAIN in
	gnutls_record_recv since it seems to sometimes call the pull function
	multiple times. Don't wait for terminating </stream:stream>, but just
	close the connection on failed TLS handshake.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Adapt to interface change
	in InfDiscovery, include device name and protocol in service name
	output.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-local-publisher.c: Replaced g_return_if_fail
	by g_return_val_if_fail in function returning non-void.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-manager.c: Unref objects retrieved via
	g_object_get(), connect to every connection's notify::status signal to
	remove the connection when it is closed.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-connection-manager.c: Remove the group from
	the list of groups in inf_connection_manager_group_free().

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Added an iterator pointing to the
	subdirectory being explored to the begin-explore signal. Don't clear
	directory tree when the connection is lost but rather when a new
	connection is set so we can still browse the explored paths when
	disconnected.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-explore-request.c: Replaced
	g_value_set_finished by g_value_set_boolean as it ought to be. I must
	have been asleep when having coded this.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-server-pool.c: Use username for service name
	when the real name is not known.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.c: Added the INVALID status, keep
	the item after disconnection so a potential error can still be
	displayed. Fixed several bugs.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c: Propagate size_request and
	size_allocate. Implemented exploration and fixed several bugs.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-io.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-io.c:
	* libinfgtk/Makefile.am: Added a InfIo implementation using the
	default Glib mainloop.

	* test/inf-test-daemon.c: Publish the infinote service on avahi.

	* test/inf-test-gtk-browser.c:
	* test/Makefile.am: Added a test showing a InfGtkBrowserView to browse
	avahi-discovered infinote servers.

2007-10-04  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT,OBJECT marshaller.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.c: Fixed return statements in
	functions returning non-void.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Added the
	infc_browser_iter_is_subdirectory() function.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-explore-request.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-explore-request.c: Added the
	infc_explore_request_get_initiated() and
	infc_explore_request_get_finished() functions.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.c: Take InfConnectionManager in
	constructor, added inf_gtk_browser_model_browser_iter_to_tree_iter()
	and the INF_GTK_BROWSER_MODEL_COL_DISCOVERY column. Fixed reordering
	when a resolve yielded an already existing connection.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-view.c:
	* libinfgtk/Makefile.am: Implemnted InfGtkBrowserView, a widget
	displaying a InfGtkBrowserModel. Some implementation bits (mostly
	exploration on expansion) are still missing.

2007-10-03  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/infc-browser.c: Removed a TODO comment that was
	already done by the last commit.

	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.h:
	* libinfgtk/inf-gtk-browser-model.c:
	* libinfgtk/Makefile.am: A container for multiple InfcBrowser and
	InfDiscovery objects that implements GtkTreeModel to be shown by a
	GtkTreeView.

	* Makefile.am: Changed order of SUBDIRS so that always the library
	directories are walked first, and then pixmaps/ and test/.

	* configure.ac: Cleaned up final status output. I still don't know why
	it sometimes appears above the "config.status: Creating Foo/Makfile"
	output.

2007-10-03  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-browser.c: Added
	infc_browser_iter_get_explore_request(),
	infc_browser_iter_from_explore_request() and the begin-explore signal.

2007-10-02  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-info.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-info.c: Removed, the functioality
	is incorporated into InfDiscovery.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-local-publisher.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-local-publisher.c:

	implemented by objects that can publish services on the local network.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.c: Removed the publish vfunc in
	favour of InfLocalPublisher. Added info_get_service_name and
	info_get_service_type vfuncs.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery-avahi.c: Class that implements
	InfDiscovery and InfLocalPublisher by using Avahi.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-server-pool.h:
	* libinfinity/server/infd-server-pool.c: Added functionality to
	associate local publishers with servers and automatically publish
	service when the corresponding server is up.

	InfXmppConnection object.

2007-09-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.h: Fix indentation.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-connection.c: Added a TODO about
	retrieving the server's (or other entity's) JID.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-tcp-connection.c: Added
	inf_tcp_connection_get_remote_address() and
	inf_tcp_connection_get_remote_port().

	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-discovery.c: Added the get_discovered vfunc
	and inf_discovery_get_discovered().

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-xmpp-manager.c:
	* libinfinity/common/Makefile.am: Added the InfXmppManager class that
	manages XMPP connections and provides lookup by IP address and port so
	that existing connections can be reused.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-storage.h: Added a TODO comment about
	possible notification when stored items change.

	* libinfgtk/Makefile.am:
	* libinfgtk-1.0.pc.in:
	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac: Added libinfgtk component, but there are not yet any
	source files.

2007-09-25  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* pixmaps/infinote.svg: Moved from artwork/infinote.svg to
	pixmaps/infinote.svg.

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: Install the icon into
	$(datadir)/hicolor/scalable/apps. I am not sure whether this in the
	correct location, though.

	* libinfinity-1.0.pc.in:
	* libinftext-1.0.pc.in:
	* Makefile.am: Added pkgconfig files, added pixmaps subdir.

	* configure.ac: Added new files to output.

	* TODO: Added gettext support to TODO list.

2007-09-25  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-net-object.c: Allow connection to be NULL in
	inf_net_object_received for now, so the session test can simulate
	incoming XML.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-user-table.c: Fixed two typos.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-buffer.c: Removed read-only property. We
	might re-introduce an editable property later.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-session.c: Cope with NULL group and sync
	connection in inf_session_set_property().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.c: Return NULL in
	inf_adopted_request_log_find_associated() when there is no Undo
	request associated to a redo request, instead of running in a failed
	assertion. This is a completely legal case for caching next_undo and
	next_redo operations.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-user.c: Cope with NULL request log
	in inf_adopted_user_set_property(), don't copy result in
	inf_adopted_user_get_vector().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-state-vector.c: Fixed a crash in
	inf_adopted_state_vector_causally_before() when the highest key
	in the first vector was not contained in the second. Also fixed a typo
	leading to a crash in inf_adotped_state_vector_from_string_diff().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-session.c: Include current request
	in last send vector after having sent the request. Otherwise, we are
	sending an unnecessary, additional "$id:1" component for each
	following request. Recognize undo requests by <undo /> child instead
	of type="undo" attribute, as in the protocol specification. Keep
	users in the user table in-sync with those in InfAdoptedAlgorithm.
	Don't leak the request in inf_adopted_session_process_xml_run().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c: Update user vector
	after having received a request, not only when having processed it.
	When transforming two operations in the request log, first transform
	both to the least common successor and then transform both from that
	point to the final destination. This way, pwords of insert operations
	are updated correctly. This could lead to a desync. Change the state
	of undo and redo requests to the same state of the original operation
	(except the issuing user's component) because they only depend on the
	original operation.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-split-operation.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-split-operation.c: Added the
	inf_adopted_split_operation_transform_other() function that transfors
	an operation against the split operation. Also don't leak the
	resulting operations in inf_adopted_split_operation_transform().

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-operation.c: Use
	inf_adopted_split_operation_transform_other() in
	inf_adopted_operation_transform() when against is a
	InfAdoptedSplitOperation. Fix a copy'n'paste error in the
	interface's GTypeInfo struct.

	* libinftext/inf-text-move-operation.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-move-operation.c: Renamed
	inf_text_move_operation_get_pword() to
	inf_text_move_operation_get_position() and
	inf_text_move_operation_get_chunk() to
	inf_text_move_operation_get_length(). This was also a copy'n'paste
	error by copying the file from libinftext/inf-text-insert-operation.c.

	* libinftext/inf-text-chunk.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-chunk.c: Added a GString to each chunk that
	holds the chunk's content without author information for integrity
	checking (can be disabled by not defining CHUNK_DEBUG). Added
	the inf_text_chunk_equal() function. Fixed two errors when inserting a
	chunk into another chunk that broke the chunk's integrity.

	* libinftext/inf-text-buffer.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-buffer.c: Reorded bytes and length parameters in
	inf_text_buffer_insert_text() to match the order of corresponding
	functions in libinftext. Allow the user parameter to be NULL in which
	case the text is inserted as author 0.

	* libinftext/inf-text-user.h:
	* libinftext/inf-text-user.c: Derive from InfAdoptedUser not from
	InfUser.

	* libinftext/inf-text-default-delete-operation.c: End g_object_new()
	invocation in inf_text_default_delete_operation_transform_split() with
	NULL so that g_object_new() does not start reading random memory.

	* libinftext/inf-text-default-insert-operation.c: Cast result to
	InfTextInsertOperation instead of InfAdoptedOperation in
	inf_text_default_insert_operation_transform_position().

	* libinftext/inf-text-remote-delete-operation.c: Append final recon
	chunk to list in inf_text_remote_delete_operation_recon_feed(). Don't
	leak the InfTextChunk obtained by inf_text_buffer_get_slice() in
	inf_text_remote_delete_operation_make_reversible(). Don't leak the
	unsplit list in the same function. Feed recon to the resulting
	operation in inf_text_remote_delete_operation_transform_overlap(), not
	to the original operation.

	* libinftext/inf-text-default-buffer.c: Implement the InfBuffer
	interface.

	* libinftext/inf-text-pword.c: Swapped the result of
	inf_text_pword_compare() when the two pwords have different length to
	obtain the intended behaviour.

	* libinftext/inf-text-session.c: Pass correct text to g_convert() and
	xmlFree() in inf_text_session_xml_to_operation(). Don't forget final
	NULL in g_object_new() call in inf_text_session_new() and
	inf_text_session_new_with_user_table().

	* test/inf-test-chunk.c: Test some basic InfTextChunk operations.

	* test/inf-test-text-operations.c: Test C1 and C2 properties of the
	InfText operations.

	* test/inf-test-text-session.c: Test the implementation of the
	concurrency control algorithm implemented by InfAdoptedAlgorithm by
	reading test scenarios from XML files in std/.

	* test/Makefile.am: Added the new files

	inf-test-text-session.c.

2007-09-17  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinftext/inf-text-operations.h: File to just forward declare

	* libinfinity/common/inf-xml-util.c: Changed an error message so that
	it includes the (errornous) request's name.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-error.c: Added a TODO comment.

	* libinfinity/common/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/common/inf-session.c: Added an error parameter to
	the process_xml_run vfunc.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-session-proxy.c: Set subscription group in

	* libinfinity/client/infc-session-proxy.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-session-proxy.c: Added InfcSessionProxy and
	InfdSessionProxy classes. These basically have the same functionality
	as the old InfcSession and InfdSession but own them rather than
	inherit from them. This is needed because GObject does not allow
	multiple inheritance: Other types can now inherit from InfSession
	while InfcSessionProxy (or InfdSessionProxy, respectively) can still
	do their job.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-note-plugin.h:

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-request-log.c: Added the
	inf_adopted_request_log_next_undo(),

	inf_adopted_request_log_upper_related() functions.

	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.h:
	* libinfinity/adopted/inf-adopted-algorithm.c:
	* libinfinity/adopted/Makefile.am: Implemented the first part of the

	* libinfinity/inf-text-chunk.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-text-chunk.c: Beginning of a InfTextChunk

	* libinfinity/adopted/Makefile.am: Build the new files.

2007-08-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/common/inf-buffer.c: Set initialized to TRUE in

	disk which was wrong in infd_filesystem_storage_read_subdirectory().

	* libinfinity/server/infd-directory.c: Only call
	infd_directory_node_remove_connection() for explored subdirectory
	nodes because only those can have connections that have explored that
	node.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-request-manager.c: Don't unref the request
	when removing from the hash table because the hash table already does
	it via its value_destroy func. Initialize the parameters array with
	zero in infc_request_manager_add_request_valist() because the GValues
	therein need to be zero-initialized.

	* test/inf-test-browser.c:
	* test/Makefile.am: Added (interactive) test for InfcBrowser
	connecting to a running infinote server.

	subdirectory.

	* libinfinity/client/infc-session.h:
	* libinfinity/client/infc-session.c: Use request manager instead of

	pointer parameter to the succeeded signal.

	* libinfinity/server/infd-xmpp-server.h:
	* libinfinity/server/infd-xmpp-server.c: Build and Runtime fixes, use

	that was missing, some more enhanced operations like copying or moving
	nodes are still not supported, though.

2007-03-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-storage.c: Renamed InfdDirectoryStorage to
	InfdStorage.

	* libinfinited/infd-note-plugin.h: Added interface for a note plugin.

	* libinfinited/infd-session.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-session.c:
	* libinfinined/Makefile.am: Implemented user joins.

2007-03-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c: Removed connection field again. I don't
	think it is useful.

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Added
	inf_session_get_synchronization_status() and an exclude parameter to
	the validate_user_props vfunc.

	* libinfinity/inf-error.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-error.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: These specify some error codes that are
	commonly used by client and server.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Connect to notify::status to find out
	when a connection is closed.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Provide getters for connection manager
	and buffer. Also do a ref on the connection we get in
	inf_session_synchronize_to() because it will be unrefed when the
	synchronization is complete or failed.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Before removing the session from the
	connection manager in inf_session_release_connection(), make sure that
	the connection manager still has the connection. If the connection was
	closed, the connection manager might have dropped the connection
	earlier.

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Refcount netobject
	registrations, but make sure objects are added with the same
	identifier.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c: Added a connection field to InfUser
	specifiying a (not necessarily direct) connection between the local
	host and that user.

2007-03-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* docs/plugin: Added notes about the plugin interface. It is not yet
	implemented, these are my just ideas how it should work, so I do not
	forget and could be expanded to a complete specification later.

2007-03-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT,DOUBLE and
	VOID:OBJECT,POINTER marshallers for synchronization signals.

	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Implemented separation between
	inner and outer queue, added enqueued vfunc in InfNetObject.

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Implemented session synchronization.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c: Minor build fixes.

	* libinfinity/docs/terminology: Added inner queue and outer queue of
	connection manager.

	* libinfinity/docs/session: Applied slight changes that came up during
	implementation.

2007-03-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/docs:
	* libinfinity/docs/terminology:
	* libinfinity/docs/session: Added some notes, mostly for me to not
	forget how things are supposed to work, but perhaps also interesting
	to others.

2007-03-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:BOOLEAN marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added common buffer interface.

	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed prerequiste from GObject to
	InfBuffer.

2007-02-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinity/infd-directory.c: Added some directory API, but most
	implementations are still missing.

2007-02-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added marshallers required for
	InfTextBuffer.

	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added InfTextBuffer interface.

	* libinfinited/inf-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/inf-directory-storage.c: Added methods to read text
	notes, write ink and text notes, create a subdirectory and
	remove nodes.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Added
	inf_connection_manager_has_connection(). Also do strong refs instead
	of weak refs on added net object. This way, net objects are kept alive
	if there are still connections open. Especially, this should allow
	keeping sessions alive even if the document in the directory tree is
	removed.

	* libinfinited/infd-server.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-server.c:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: New server class managing acception of
	incoming connections and (yet to come) service publishing.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Implemented directory tree structure,
	but accessing background storage and handling client requests still
	missing.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c:
	* Makefile.am: Added InfUser and InfSession classes.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed signal flags for the
	remove-stroke signal from G_SIGNAL_RUN_CLEANUP to G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST
	and surrounded the signal emission by a g_object_ref / g_object_unref
	pair. This way, the stroke should stay alive after having been removed
	from the buffer and signal handlers running after the default handler
	don't get corrupted memory.

2007-02-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.c: Renamed from InfStroke to
	InfInkStroke.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Made an interface out of InfBuffer,
	renamed to InfInkBuffer.

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Adjusted build rules for renamed files.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c: Include inf-ink-buffer.h
	instead of inf-buffer.h, added text node type for upcoming
	collaborative text editing support, removed empty flag from node
	(client should query a node to check whether it is empty, this way it
	can also treat it as empty if it only contains nodes it is not
	interested in, for example a subdirectory containing only ink nodes
	will be shown empty in a text editor).

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Added GNetworkTcpServer object, close
	on error.

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Take a reference of the
	connection in inf_connection_manager_add_connection().

	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-marshal.in:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: Added interface for directory storage in
	libinfinited and initial directory class.

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac: Build libinfinited.

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity: Renamed infinity directory to libinfinity.

	* configure.ac:
	* Makefile.am:

	* infinity/inf-buffer.c: Added InfBuffer class managing multiple
	InfStrokes.

	* infinity/inf-marshal.in: Added input file for glib-genmarshal.

	* infinity/Makefile.am: Create inf-marshal.h and inf-marshal.c from
	inf-marshal.in. Also added inf-buffer.c to build.

2007-02-20  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-stroke.h:
	* infinity/inf-stroke.c: Added position to InfStroke to which
	the coordinates of the contained InfStrokePoints are relative.

2007-02-20  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-xml-stream.c:
	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Documentation fixes.

	* infinity/inf-net-object.c: Removed return in inf_net_object_sent()
	and inf_net_object_received() because these functions are void.

	* infinity/inf-stroke.h:
	* infinity/inf-stroke.c: Added object representing a single stroke.

	* infinity/Makefile.am: Added inf-stroke.c to build.

2007-02-19  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Implemented message processing
	and inf_connection_manager_send_to_object().

	inf-net-object.[ch].

2007-02-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-netobject.h: Replaced INF_NET_OBJECT_TYPE by
	INF_TYPE_NET_OBJECT to follow gobject naming conventions.
